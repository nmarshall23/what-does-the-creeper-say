## Page1

Watering cans speed up crop growth, spread Mycelium or Grass to dirt, moisturizing farmland, or grow Saplings. You will need to refill these watering cans from a water source. 

Your basic Watering can is made of Stone. The Wooden version can not grow crops, but spawns flowers on grass a high rate.

Iron has a larger spread then Stone, and grows crops quicker then stone.

The gold watercan will grow crops at the slowest speed, but spawn flowers on grass at a high rate. It has the same spread that Iron does.

Diamond has the largest spread but can't be used in a dispenser.  It also never needs to be refilled.
