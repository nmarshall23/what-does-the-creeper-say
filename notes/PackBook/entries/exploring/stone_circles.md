## Page1

In *flat biomes* (such as plains and desert) you may find a stone circle constructed from cobblestone and stone. Some of the stone pillars may have a [Runestone](https://svenhjol.github.io/Strange/features/runestones) on the top. With the proper tools and some study, these runestones can help you reach distant locations.

It is possible to obtain a special compass to the closest stone circle by holding a normal compass and an iron ingot under a full moon. This compass can be turned back into a normal compass on a crafting table.

Runestone blocks can be harvested with a silk touch pickaxe.

Once you have found a runestone throw an *ender pearl* at it. Care should be taken as may of those who did this have not been seen again. Who know what kind of dangerest place you might be transported to.
