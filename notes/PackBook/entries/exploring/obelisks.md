Once you have a complete set of glyphs for a location entry in your travel journal, build a vertical obelisk from stones with glyphs that **precisely match** the order in the journal. When finished, throw an ender pearl at the completed obelisk to travel immediately to the location descibed in your journal. There is no limit to the number of times you may travel, but an ender pearl is required for each journey.

If you want, you can take apart your obelisk using a Silk Touch enchanted pickaxe.

Obelisk blocks also provide a bonus to the Enchanting Table with the same power as a bookshelf.



Obelisks are vertical stacks of [Runestones](https://svenhjol.github.io/Strange/features/runestones) constructed by a player. The order of the glyphs in the obelisk matches that of a location anywhere in the Overworld.

Every location entry created in a [Travel Journal](https://svenhjol.github.io/Strange/features/travel_journal) comes with a unique set of glyphs that describe the entry’s exact position in the Overworld. At first, these glpyhs will be unknown and will appear as question marks. By travelling through [Runestones](https://svenhjol.github.io/Strange/features/runestones), you “learn” glyphs. Learned glyphs then appear as part of the set of glyphs for the location in the journal.

When you have discovered all the required runestone glyphs (there are no more question marks) you may build an obelisk that exactly matches the order of glyphs in the journal.
