# Anvil



Extract enchantments from any enchanted item into an empty book on an anvil. Enchantments at level 1 will be preserved, but enchantments higher than level 1 will be weakened by one level. The enchanted item will be destroyed in the process.

Pig iron nuggets can be combined on an anvil with a tool, weapon or armor to give a small durability boost regardless of the material the item is made from. Repairing tools with pig iron does not add to their repair cost.
